_suffixtree_ : suffix trees in linear time

Danny Yoo (dyoo@hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu)


Introduction
============

This package allows us to play with suffix trees; it implements
Ukkonen's linear time algorithm to construct these suffix trees
efficiently.  BSD license.


Documentation
=============
See 'doc.txt' for documentation on the API.


Miscellaneous
=============

To build the PLaneT archive, run the 'build-planet.ss' script.  This
will build a new plt package and place it in a dist/ subdirectory.

To run all unit tests (including the ones for the private
implementation), run 'test-all.ss'.  This assumes that we can access
the schemeunit PLaneT package.
